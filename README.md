# customer-churn-ann

In this project, 
I built a model which demonstrates working of Artificial Neural Networks. 
Took a customer churn data set which contains meta data of a customer and information about whether he left this particular bank or not. I used the meta data of the customer to feed it to neural networks and built a model, this model when given meta data of a new customer predicts the probabality of that customer leaving the bank or not.
